My research and pedagogy are deeply invested learning and its application to future contexts. My MA and PhD research focuses on how students acquire and deploy rhetorical strategies and skills within the social, material, and technological landscapes in which they work. I teach in the areas of social theory, social science research, writing, web development, and Python. At heart, I am a maker and have devoted a great deal of energy to creating projects and programs to address problems I see in the world around me. This lead me to develop a transition workshop for service members, which I taught for four years at Joint Base Lewis-McChord. I also lead a team developing Cluster\u2014a suite of tools that work like a personal writing trainer. In the summer, I teach a Python camp for underrepresented kids.
